# FluEgg-Utilities
Utility codes related to the FluEgg project

## Synopsis

This repository contains auxiliary functions and data that extend the capabilities of the Fluvial Egg Drift Modeling software (FluEgg) beyond the simulation of egg and larvae transport.

The functions in this repository allows to detect potential spawning events. Future additions will be added and documented as well. The scripts are written in MatLab (2016b) to facilitate the integration with the FluEgg environment.

### Detection of potential spawning events
The first utility is a Spawning Event Anaylsis. It's primiary goal is to identify events within a period that complies certain criteria (ex. exceed a flow threshold) that are considered triggers of spawning events. Such criteria depends on flow and water properties, and species. It's the analyst (utility user) who must defined what's the criteria to be considered as a trigger.

The first example for the Spawning Events Detection is an application to Grass Carp in the Sandusky River, OH. As a reference for the flow discharge, this example uses the 30-min record from 01Jan2011 - 01Jan2017 at the Fremont USGS Station (USGS04198000).

The trigger flow is a minimum flow observed for documented spawining events. Spawning observations come from Grass Carp eggs collected during field campaigns in 2015 by the USGS-OH and the University of Toledo (OH). The collection time was corrected by the age of the eggs to obtain a spawning time. This was the reference time was when consulting the Flow Discharge records.

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

Software requirements:
* Matlab 2015a
* HEC-DSSVue 2.0.1

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

<Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.>

In this example the minimum flow discharge when eggs were collected was 130.64 mÂ³/s at Fremont gage station.

Any period between 01Jan2011 and 01Jan2017 above that value was identified by the Spawning Event Analysis as a potential spawning event of Grass Carp in the Sandusky River.

The function requires the user to define:

* A file containing the spawning time and corresponding flow discharge for each spawning event (*spawning.events.2015*)
* A file containing the flow discharges at regular intervals (*Fremont.FLOWS.2011.2016.txt*)
* MatLab scripts (*spawning_events_analysis.m* and *parse_date.m*)

### Exporting DSS data
Open HEC-DSSVue

Open DSS file and select a path to data (ex.: /STATION/TYPE/VARIABLE/TIME WINDOW/FREQUENCY/NOTE)

*Menu Bar* > *Display* > *Tabulate*

*File* > *Export* (Check the following options)

* Fixed Width Columns
* Include Column headers
* Print Title

*Save as*: **filename.txt** (Save as text file)
